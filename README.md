# generate-launching-images

A tool to generate runcommand launching images based on emulationstation themes (for use on RetroPie).

This tool was made to be used with RetroPie.

To install it you just have to launch RetroPie Setup script and then "Manage Packages" >> "Manage experimental packages" >> "launchingimages" >> "Install from binary"

After the installation, the option "launchingimages" will be available at RetroPie-Setup >> "Configuration / tools" >> "launchingimages". Just follow the instructions on screen. ;-)

Just for reference, this tool was initially anounced on this forum post:\
